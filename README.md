# lineage-analysis
Repository containing scripts and data for the analysis of the persistence and growth of arbitrary lineage annotations for SARS-CoV-2 over a series of public phylogenies. 

## Usage

You can obtain a historical time series of protobufs by choosing dates and downloading those days' global phylogenies from [here](http://hgdownload.soe.ucsc.edu/goldenPath/wuhCor1/UShER_SARS-CoV-2/). 

You will need [BTE](https://github.com/jmcbroome/BTE) and [matUtils](https://github.com/yatisht/usher) to be available in your environment. You can install them locally from their repositories or through the bioconda channel.

Once your environment is set up and your files are available, run the following:

```
for f in *pb.gz ; do 
    export PREFIX=${f%.all.masked.pb.gz} ; 
    matUtils annotate -T 4 -i $PREFIX.all.masked.pb.gz -P floating_paths.txt floating_samples_clades.txt -o $PREFIX.pb ; 
    gzip $PREFIX.pb ; 
    cd automate-lineages-prototype ; 
    snakemake -c1 -s flag_lineages.smk ../$PREFIX.proposed.report.tsv ; 
    cd .. ; 
    matUtils extract -i $PREFIX.proposed.pb â€“clade-paths floating_paths.base.txt ; awk -F'\t' '{{print $1"\t"$3}}' floating_paths.base.txt | tail -n +2 > floating_paths.txt ; 
    python3 extract_samples_clades.py $PREFIX.proposed.pb > floating_samples_clades.txt ; 
done
```

This automatically infers new lineages on each tree in your time series, propagating inferred lineages between trees. It may not be in the correct order with a simple glob, depending on the dates selected and how they translate to bash default sorting.
